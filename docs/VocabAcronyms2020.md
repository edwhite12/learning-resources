## Vocabulary

This page explains some of the terms encountered during Cyberseminars and Online Tutorials with links to resources on where to learn more about them.

### Platforms

__Hydroshare__ -  an online, collaborative Hydrologic Information System for sharing hydrologic data, models, and code. www.hydroshare.org

__Public Cloud__ - publicly accessible to anyone for scalable research computing supported by commercial platforms. Option 1: write a proposal to include funding to pay for the cloud. 

__Publicly Funded Research and Education Cloud__ - Federal resources are available to support you and your research computing needs, as well as research community software development and cyberinfrastructure. National Science Foundation funded platforms like CUAHSI JuptyerHub, CyberGIS for Water, The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). Option 2: write a proposal to access the compute resources for your research. HydroShare and Jupyterhub teams have done the work to make it easy to launch 'to cloud' this week - that is one server (now on Google, used to be RENCI in North Carolina) that CUAHSI pays for as part of [our collaborative NSF CyberTraining grant](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1829585&HistoricalAwards=false).

### Software Libraries

Numpy: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications.

Pandas: Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

Anaconda: Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

### Tools and Methods

Jupyter Notebooks: The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more

Docker: An image is a executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.   A container is a runtime instance of an image – what the image becomes in memory when actually executed. It runs completely isolated from the host environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to do so.

Landlab – a Python-based modeling environment that allows scientists and students to build numerical landscape models.

## Acronyms

__CUAHSI__: The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. is a 501(c) 3 research organization representing more than 100 U.S. universities and international water science-related organizations.  In addition to HydroShare NSF PI and community support, CUAHSI will maintain, develop and support HydroShare infrastructure and users. 

__CUAHSI_VU__: CUAHSI Virtual University - an online, three-module collaborative learning platform for graduate students who attend a university that is a member of CUAHSI. 

__XSEDE__: The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) is a single virtual system that scientists can use to interactively share computing resources, data and expertise.

__CyberGIS__  - a center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies. They support big geospatial data solutions in many areas of scholarship, ranging from engineering and science to the humanities.

__AGU__: American Geophysical Union

__NCSA__ - National Center for Supercomputing Applications at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

__ROGER__ - Resourcing Open Geospatial Education and Research and the Father of GIS, Roger Tomlinson) is the world's first-ever CyberGIS Supercomputer designed especially for computationally intensive geospatial data processing and analysis. ROGER is managed by NCSA at the CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies



## Team Science 
The mission of Canary Opera at Waterhackweek is to facilitate an open work platform so that all participants can learn without hindrance, freely create new innovations, and share ideas -- with shared benefits for the learning community and broader impacts on society.  [Contribute more at Canary Opera](https://github.com/canaryopera/learning-resources)

Canary: a domesticated bird that belongs to the finch family, a songbird that originated from the Canary Islands. Among their breed, only male canary birds have the ability to sing.

Canary in the coal mine: Someone/something that is an early warning of danger.

Canary as a metaphor: yellow, sun, reflection provides energy, spreading light, eliminating darkness.

Canary as a symbol: A flying canary is a symbol of freedom.

Canary as a totem: The Canary teaches us the power of one's voice, to control speaking abilities, and to listen to your inner-self. The ability to strategically raise and lower voice results in a unique chirped melody; a canary provides power to control your voice, feelings, and emotions in order to heal; to breathe fresh air and live freely without hindrance.

Canary Opera: a community development mechanism used in workshops to highlight positive things in self, life, and work. The opera is a metaphor for learning that is shared by a group of people by spreading joy while addressing difficult and uncomfortable roadblocks to learning. The blend of opposite challenges and achievements can bring new ideas, innovation, and geohealth, broadly inclusive of personal, workplace, community, planetary systems.

If the animal became ill or died, that would give miners a warning to evacuate. More than 200 canary birds were phased out of Britain's mining pits, according to new plans by the government. ... New electronic detectors will replace the bird because they are said to be cheaper in the long run and more effective in indicating the presence of pollutants in the air otherwise unnoticed by miners.

[Canary in the Coal Mine: The Arctic as a National Imperative](https://www.cfr.org/blog/canary-coal-mine-arctic-national-imperative); March, 2017 The Arctic is changing rapidly. ... It is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet, causing sea ice to melt and water levels to rise. The looming question, of course, is whether this report’s grave findings and urgent recommendations will find a receptive audience in Washington—or instead, fall on deaf ears.
